  Vector mountain landscape illustration, 8 distinct components for easy vectorization: (1) solid peach-pink sky background, (2) large cream-colored sun as perfect circle in upper third of composition, (3) four detailed black cedar trees in foreground - two taller ones framing far edges, two slightly shorter ones beside them, with distinct angular branch patterns, (4) large flock of 15-20 small black birds in loose formation crossing the sun, (5) two mountain ranges - front range in solid slate blue, back range with detailed snow-capped peaks in lighter grey-blue with white highlights, (6) row of small black pine tree silhouettes along valley floor creating treeline, (7) black forest silhouette along bottom edge with irregular treetop line for natural feel, (8) subtle shadow cast on sun's edge where birds cross
